\DoxyCodeLine{******************* GETTING STARTED ********************}
\DoxyCodeLine{ALL PLATFORMS:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Just copy paste Gateware.h and LICENSE.md into your C++11 64bit console project.}
\DoxyCodeLine{(if you don't see Gateware.h this means you downloaded the main repo used }
\DoxyCodeLine{for development. Instead go back to "Releases" on our GitLab page and download)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{in your source file:}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \#define GATEWARE\_ENABLE\_CORE}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \#include "Gateware.h" }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{This should compile on any standard C++11 compiler.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Gateware is designed to be Modular so by default it is quite basic.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Next Step is to open the included Docs(index.html) and see what is available. }
\DoxyCodeLine{Once you spot a library you want to use just \#define it's namespace:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define GATEWARE\_ENABLE\_CORE // This is called white-\/lisitng}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define GATEWARE\_ENABLE\_SYSTEM // Enables valid implementations}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include "Gateware.h" }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Note: Most Classes will still compile, even without the \#define but will not be functional. }
\DoxyCodeLine{Many more complex libs rely on SYSTEM so that is a good one to have typically enabled.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{You can also disable specific libraries in a group:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define GATEWARE\_ENABLE\_CORE}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define GATEWARE\_ENABLE\_SYSTEM}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define GATEWARE\_DISABLE\_GWINDOW // This is called black-\/listing}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include "Gateware.h" }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Use them to shorten compile times and reduce binary size.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library Basics:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{All Gateware objects are considered "Proxies". }
\DoxyCodeLine{Proxies are basically smart pointers that have strong \& weak binding. }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// To make a valid library interface, declare and "Create(...)"}
\DoxyCodeLine{GW::SYSTEM::GWindow myWin;}
\DoxyCodeLine{if (+myWin.Create(0, 0, 500, 500, GW::SYSTEM::GWindowStyle::WINDOWEDBORDERED))}
\DoxyCodeLine{    std::cout << "Gateware window was created" << std::endl;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{ALL Gateware routines return a GW:GReturn error/success code.}
\DoxyCodeLine{The '+' above is a shortcut to see if the return was a good one.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{When you copy proxies they are considered to have "weak" binding.}
\DoxyCodeLine{This means they will only be valid for the lifetime of the right hand proxy you copied from. }
\DoxyCodeLine{When you move proxies they are considered to have "strong" binding.}
\DoxyCodeLine{This means they stay valid for the lifetime of the object. }
\DoxyCodeLine{You can check the validity of a Proxy using simple boolean logic. (ex: if (Proxy)\{\} )}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Tips:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{All Created proxies can "Share()", "Mirror()" and "Relinquish()".}
\DoxyCodeLine{You can use these operations to more carefully control a proxies lifetime.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{To "delete" a proxy just let it fall out of scope or "MyGProxy = nullptr;" }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Gateware arguments are heavily templated behind the scenes. }
\DoxyCodeLine{If you want "intellisense" to see what they are use the "-\/-\/-\/>" operator on a Proxy. }
\DoxyCodeLine{Just be sure to remove it after, they are not meant for actual use and call abort()}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{If you heavily use Gateware.h in multiple places consider placing it in a pre-\/compiled header to reduce compile times.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{"GW::I" is an internal namespace, ignore it unless you want to become a Gateware developer/contributor. }
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Some libraries outside the Core have a couple manual dependencies depending on platform. }
\DoxyCodeLine{See the below section to resolve them. }
